# __Classification for the Heart Attack Dataset__

## The following classification methods are used:

__Gaussian Naive Bayes__

__K-Nearest Neighbors__

__Radius Nearest Neighbors__

__Decision Tree__

__Support Vector Machine__

__Logistic Regression__




All methods use cross validation and predictions are evaluated with recall and F1 scores as accuracy score does not suffice in a medical setting.

Plots of all algorithm predictions are displayed to compare results.
